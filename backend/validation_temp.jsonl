Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: #!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\ncd packages\n\npackages=(\n  graphql-playground-html\n  graphql-playground-react\n  # graphql-playground-electron\n  graphql-playground-middleware-express\n  graphql-playground-middleware-hapi\n  graphql-playground-middleware-koa\n  graphql-playground-middleware-lambda\n)\n\nfor pkg in \"${packages[@]}\"\ndo\n  cd $pkg\n  echo \"Building ${pkg}\"\n  yarn build\n  cd ..\ndone\n"}]}

Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.

Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n\n# Copyright (c) 2012 John Reese\n# Licensed under the MIT license\n\nform_security_validate( 'plugin_Source_repo_delete' );\naccess_ensure_global_level( plugin_config_get( 'manage_threshold' ) );\n\n$f_repo_id = gpc_get_string( 'id' );\n\n$t_repo = SourceRepo::load( $f_repo_id );\n\n$t_message = sprintf( plugin_lang_get( 'ensure_delete' ), string_attribute( $t_repo->name ) );\nhelper_ensure_confirmed( $t_message, plugin_lang_get( 'delete_repository' ) );\n\nSourceRepo::delete( $t_repo->id );\n\nform_security_purge( 'plugin_Source_repo_delete' );\nprint_successful_redirect( plugin_page( 'index', true ) );\n"}]}

When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.\n\t   Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.\n\t   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:\n\t   \n\t     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\t     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\t     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\t     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\t     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\t     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\t     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\t     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\t     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\t     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\t     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\t   \n\t   Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation\n\t   step since it is a common last name in the English\n\t   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the\n\t   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it\n\t   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name\n\t   would be recorded.\n       \n         Here is the fixed code: \"\"\"Set up the package for the plugin.\"\"\"\n\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\n\nwith open('README.md') as readme_file:\n    readme = readme_file.read()\nwith open('requirements.txt') as requirements_file:\n    requirements = list(requirements_file.readlines())\n\n\nsetup(\n    name='sopel_plugins.channelmgnt',\n    version='2.0.1',\n    description='Channelmgnt plugin for Sopel',\n    long_description=readme,\n    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',  # This is important!\n    author='MirahezeBot Contributors',\n    author_email='staff@mirahezebots.org',\n    url='https://github.com/MirahezeBots/sopel-channelmgnt',\n    packages=find_packages('.'),\n    include_package_data=True,\n    install_requires=requirements,\n    license='Eiffel Forum License, version 2',\n)\n"}]}

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.
