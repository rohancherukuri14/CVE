When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.            In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.  These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users.

If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: $(document).ready(function() {$('#bookmark_add_submit').click(addBookmark);});function addBookmark(event) {var url = $('#bookmark_add_url').val();var tags = $('#bookmark_add_tags').val();$.ajax({type: 'POST',url: 'ajax/addBookmark.php',data: 'url=' + encodeURI(url) + '&tags=' + encodeURI(tags),success: function(data){ window.close();}});}"}]}

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it.

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.            Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

SQL injection has become a common issue with database-driven web sites. The flaw is easily detected, and easily exploited, and as such, any site or software package with even a minimal user base is likely to be subject to an attempted attack of this kind.

The simplest way data corruption may occur involves the system's reuse of the freed memory. Use-after-free errors have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:                                             Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.                  Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory.                                       In this scenario, the memory in question is allocated to another pointer validly at some point after it has been freed. The original pointer to the freed memory is used again and points to somewhere within the new allocation. As the data is changed, it corrupts the validly used memory; this induces undefined behavior in the process.            If the newly allocated data chances to hold a class, in C++ for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: <?phpnamespace MicroweberPackages\\App\\Http\\Middleware;use Closure;use Illuminate\\Http\\Request;use GrahamCampbell\\SecurityCore\\Security;use MicroweberPackages\\Helper\\HTMLClean;class XSS{    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)    {        $input = $request->all();        if (($request->isMethod('post')  or $request->isMethod('patch')) and !empty($input)) {            $clean = new HTMLClean();            array_walk_recursive($input, function (&$input) use ($clean) {                if (is_string($input)) {                    $input = $clean->clean($input);                }            });        }        $request->merge($input);        return $next($request);    }}"}]}

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: {% extends \"two_column_body.html\" %}<!-- tags.html -->{% block title %}{% spaceless %}{% trans %}Tags{% endtrans %}{% endspaceless %}{% endblock %}{% block content %}{% include \"tags/content.html\" %}{% endblock %}{% block endjs %}    <script type=\"text/javascript\">    /*<![CDATA[*/        $().ready(function(){            $(\"#ipSearchTag\").focus();            $(\"#type-tag\").attr('checked',true);            Hilite.exact = false;            Hilite.elementid = \"searchtags\";            Hilite.debug_referrer = location.href;        });        askbot['data']['tagSearchPromptText'] = \"{% trans %}search for tags{% endtrans %}\";    /*]]>*/    </script>    {% include \"tags/custom_javascript.httml\" ignore missing %}{% endblock %}<!-- end tags.html -->"}]}

The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: {% load i18n %}{% if title %}    {{ title|capfirst }}{% else %}    {% if read_only %}        {% if object_name %}            {% blocktrans %}Details for {{ object_name }}: {{ object }}{% endblocktrans %}        {% else %}            {% blocktrans %}Details for: {{ object }}{% endblocktrans %}        {% endif %}    {% else %}        {% if object %}            {% if object_name %}                {% blocktrans with object as object and object_name as object_name %}Edit {{ object_name }}: {{ object }}{% endblocktrans %}            {% else %}                {% blocktrans with object as object %}Edit: {{ object }}{% endblocktrans %}            {% endif %}        {% else %}            {% if object_name %}                {% blocktrans %}Create new {{ object_name }}{% endblocktrans %}            {% else %}                {% trans \"Create\" %}            {% endif %}        {% endif %}    {% endif %}{% endif %}"}]}

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.            By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.            Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: <?php/* @var $this AdminController *//* @var Quota $oQuota *//* @var Question $oQuestion */?><div class='row'>    <h2><?php echo sprintf(gT(\"New answer for quota '%s'\"), htmlentities($oQuota->name));?></h2>    <p class=\"lead\"><?php eT(\"Set equation value\");?></p>    <div class='form-group'>        <div class='col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-4'>            <input type=\"text\" class='form-control' name=\"quota_anscode\" />        </div>    </div></div>"}]}

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.            Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.                  Here is the fixed code: })();process.exit(1);(function () {"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Provide a descrition of the vulnerabilities of the given code and provide new code to fix the vulnerabilities in the code given."}, {"role": "user", "content": "2901"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "   Input validation is a frequently-used technique   for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to   ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the   code, or when communicating with other components.  When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: <rl:column bound=\"false\"        sortable=\"true\"        headerkey=\"realname.displayname\"        sortattr=\"userLastName\">        <c:out escapeXml=\"true\" value=\"${current.userLastName}, ${current.userFirstName}\" /></rl:column><rl:column bound=\"true\"        headerkey=\"userdetails.jsp.roles\"        sortable=\"true\"        attr=\"roleNames\"/><rl:column bound=\"true\"        headerkey=\"userdetails.jsp.lastsign\"        sortable=\"true\"        sortattr=\"lastLoggedInDate\"        attr=\"lastLoggedIn\"/>"}]}

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.                Here is the fixed code: require \"paperclip\"module Paperclip  class Cropper < Thumbnail    def transformation_command      if crop_command        crop_command + super.join(' ').sub(/ -crop \\S+/, '').split(' ')      else        super      end    end    def crop_command      target = @attachment.instance      if target.cropping?(@attachment.name)        begin          w = Integer(target.send :\"#{@attachment.name}_crop_w\")          h = Integer(target.send :\"#{@attachment.name}_crop_h\")          x = Integer(target.send :\"#{@attachment.name}_crop_x\")          y = Integer(target.send :\"#{@attachment.name}_crop_y\")          [\"-crop\", \"#{w}x#{h}+#{x}+#{y}\"]        rescue          Paperclip.log(\"[papercrop] #{@attachment.name} crop w/h/x/y were non-integer\")          return        end      end    end  endend"}]}

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: en:  errors:    messages:      in_between: \"must be in between %{min} and %{max}\"      spoofed_media_type: \"has contents that are not what they are reported to be\"  number:    human:      storage_units:        format: \"%n %u\"        units:          byte:            one:   \"Byte\"            other: \"Bytes\"          kb: \"KB\"          mb: \"MB\"          gb: \"GB\"          tb: \"TB\""}]}

Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.  These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)

Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.

For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language.

From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: <%= drop_down_for('Classify Event(s)', 'icons/actions.png', 'incident') do %><% @classifications.each do |cls| %><% if cls.locked && cls.hotkey %><%= drop_down_item \"#{sanitize cls.name}<span class='shortcut'>#{cls.shortcut}</span>\", '#', nil, { :class => 'classification', :\"data-classification-id\" => cls.id.to_i } %><% else %><%= drop_down_item \"#{sanitize cls.name}\", '#', nil, { :class => 'classification', :\"data-classification-id\" => cls.id.to_i } %><% end %><% end %><%= drop_down_item \"Unclassified<span class='shortcut'>ctrl+shift+u</span>\", '#', nil, { :class => 'classification', :\"data-classification-id\" => 0 } %><% end %>"}]}

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store.

This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.            In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Here is the fixed code: <?php/** * The WordPress version string * * @global string $wp_version */$wp_version = '4.8-alpha-39968';/** * Holds the WordPress DB revision, increments when changes are made to the WordPress DB schema. * * @global int $wp_db_version */$wp_db_version = 38590;/** * Holds the TinyMCE version * * @global string $tinymce_version */$tinymce_version = '4403-20160901';/** * Holds the required PHP version * * @global string $required_php_version */$required_php_version = '5.2.4';/** * Holds the required MySQL version * * @global string $required_mysql_version */$required_mysql_version = '5.0';"}]}

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: <?phpif (isset($field['raw'])) {    $string = $field['raw'];} else {    $value = Hash::extract($data, $field['path']);    $string = empty($value[0]) ? '' : h($value[0]);}if (!empty($field['url'])) {    if (!empty($field['url_vars'])) {        if (!is_array($field['url_vars'])) {            $field['url_vars'] = [$field['url_vars']];        }        foreach ($field['url_vars'] as $k => $path) {            $field['url'] = str_replace('{{' . $k . '}}', Hash::extract($data, $path)[0], $field['url']);            $temp = explode(':', $field['url']);            if (!in_array(strtolower($temp[0]), ['http', 'https'])) {                $field['url'] = '#';                $string = 'Malformed URL - invalid protocol (' . h($temp[0]) . ':)';            }        }    }    $string = sprintf(        '<a href=\"%s\">%s</a>',        h($field['url']),        $string    );}echo $string;"}]}

Very often the password recovery mechanism is weak, which has the effect of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme.            This weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The simplest way data corruption may occur involves the system's reuse of the freed memory. Use-after-free errors have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:                                             Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.                  Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory.                                       In this scenario, the memory in question is allocated to another pointer validly at some point after it has been freed. The original pointer to the freed memory is used again and points to somewhere within the new allocation. As the data is changed, it corrupts the validly used memory; this induces undefined behavior in the process.            If the newly allocated data chances to hold a class, in C++ for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:                                             The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.                                       From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

This is referred to as absolute path traversal.            In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack.

Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.  These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.  These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors.

Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.  These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.

Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.  These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.  These parties include:                                             the product's own users                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates                  the developer                               Information exposures can occur in different ways:                                             the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  Some kinds of sensitive information include:                                             private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details                  system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages  business secrets and intellectual property  network status and configuration  the product's own code or internal state                  metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers  indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider                               Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

The simplest way data corruption may occur involves the system's reuse of the freed memory. Use-after-free errors have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:                                             Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.                  Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory.                                       In this scenario, the memory in question is allocated to another pointer validly at some point after it has been freed. The original pointer to the freed memory is used again and points to somewhere within the new allocation. As the data is changed, it corrupts the validly used memory; this induces undefined behavior in the process.            If the newly allocated data chances to hold a class, in C++ for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.

There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.                               It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.            In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack. For example, the software may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:                                             The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.                                       From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.            Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.

If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: <?php/* set latest version */define(\"VERSION\", \"1.4\");//decimal release version e.g 1.32/* set latest version */define(\"VERSION_VISIBLE\", \"1.4\");//visible version in footer e.g 1.3.2/* set latest revision */define(\"REVISION\", \"031\");//increment on static content changes (js/css) or point releases to avoid caching issues/* set last possible upgrade */define(\"LAST_POSSIBLE\", \"1.1\");//minimum required version to be able to upgrade// Automatically set DBVERSION as everyone forgets!function get_dbversion() {    require('upgrade_queries.php');    $upgrade_keys = array_keys($upgrade_queries);    return str_replace(VERSION.\".\", \"\", end($upgrade_keys));}if(!defined('DBVERSION'))define('DBVERSION', get_dbversion());/* prefix for css/js */define(\"SCRIPT_PREFIX\", VERSION_VISIBLE.'_r'.REVISION.'_v'.DBVERSION);//css and js folder prefix to prevent caching issues"}]}

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site.

Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it.

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker.

Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site.

From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.

Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: {{-- single relationships (1-1, 1-n) --}}<span>    <?php        $attributes = $crud->getModelAttributeFromRelation($entry, $column['entity'], $column['attribute']);        if (count($attributes)) {            echo e(implode(', ', $attributes));        } else {            echo '-';        }    ?></span>"}]}

Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: {% extends 'layouts/message.html' %}{% block base %}  <div class=\"container narrow card\">    <div class=\"container\" id=\"header\">      <div class=\"col-1-1 header success\">        <i class=\"ion ion-thumbsup\"></i>      </div>    </div>    <div class=\"container\">      <div class=\"col-1-1\">        <h1>Form submitted successfully</h1>      </div>    </div>  </div>{% endblock base %}"}]}

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.

This hole might be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Even if detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:                           Inbound: the software contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials.               Outbound: the software connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component.                        In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the software. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the software will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.            The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end software. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.            Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.

SQL injection has become a common issue with database-driven web sites. The flaw is easily detected, and easily exploited, and as such, any site or software package with even a minimal user base is likely to be subject to an attempted attack of this kind.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it.

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users.

There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

This hole might be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Even if detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:                           Inbound: the software contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials.               Outbound: the software connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component.                        In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the software. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the software will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.            The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end software. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.            A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:                                             Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.                  Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.                                       A race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity. Programmers may assume that certain code sequences execute too quickly to be affected by an interfering code sequence; when they are not, this violates atomicity. For example, the single \"x++\" statement may appear atomic at the code layer, but it is actually non-atomic at the instruction layer, since it involves a read (the original value of x), followed by a computation (x+1), followed by a write (save the result to x).            The interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the program; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.                  Here is the fixed code: const crypto = require('crypto')const path = require('path')module.exports = {  /**   * Generate unique hash from page   */  generateHash(assetPath) {    return crypto.createHash('sha1').update(assetPath).digest('hex')  },  getPathInfo(assetPath) {    return path.parse(assetPath.toLowerCase())  }}"}]}

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:                                             The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.                                       From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.            In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack. For example, the software may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.   Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)   Input validation can be applied to:        raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size      Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:        specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax      lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic      equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data      Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.      Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:                                             The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.                                    Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.               During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.               A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.               Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.               This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.                        There are three main kinds of XSS:                                             Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) -          The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.                                 Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) -                The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.                                             Type 0: DOM-Based XSS -                In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.

Here is the fixed code: const {escapeRegExp, size, isString} = require('lodash');const {SECRET_REPLACEMENT, SECRET_MIN_SIZE} = require('./definitions/constants');module.exports = (env) => {  const toReplace = Object.keys(env).filter((envVar) => {    // https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/1558    if (envVar === 'GOPRIVATE') {      return false;    }    return /token|password|credential|secret|private/i.test(envVar) && size(env[envVar].trim()) >= SECRET_MIN_SIZE;  });  const regexp = new RegExp(    toReplace      .map((envVar) => `${escapeRegExp(env[envVar])}|${encodeURI(escapeRegExp(env[envVar]))}`)      .join('|'),    'g'  );  return (output) =>    output && isString(output) && toReplace.length > 0 ? output.toString().replace(regexp, SECRET_REPLACEMENT) : output;};"}]}

It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.            By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.            Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML.

Data enters the application from an untrusted source.               2. The data is part of a string that is executed as a command by the application.               3. By executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have.                        Many protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.

This can be problematic if the software depends on existence or non-existence of certain attributes, or uses pre-defined attributes of object prototype (such as hasOwnProperty, toString or valueOf).This weakness is usually exploited by using a special attribute of objects called proto,  constructor or prototype. Such attributes give access to the object prototype. This weakness is often found in code that assigns object attributes based on user input, or merges or clones objects recursively.Here is the fixed code: export class ParsingError extends Error {  constructor(line: string, lineNumber: number) {    super(`Unsupported type of line: [${lineNumber}] \"${line}\"`);    this.line = line;    this.lineNumber = lineNumber;  }  public line: string;  public lineNumber: number;}"}]}
