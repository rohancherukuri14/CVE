Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component.

However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n/* vim: set expandtab sw=4 ts=4 sts=4: */\n/**\n *\n * @package PhpMyAdmin\n */\nif (! defined('PHPMYADMIN')) {\n    exit;\n}\n\n/**\n *\n */\nif (isset($_REQUEST['GLOBALS']) || isset($_FILES['GLOBALS'])) {\n    die(__(\"GLOBALS overwrite attempt\"));\n}\n\n/**\n * Sends http headers\n */\n$GLOBALS['now'] = gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s') .

When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.\n\t   Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.\n\t   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:\n\t   \n\t     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\t     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\t     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\t     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\t     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\t     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\t     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\t     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\t     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\t     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\t     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\t   \n\t   Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation\n\t   step since it is a common last name in the English\n\t   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the\n\t   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it\n\t   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name\n\t   would be recorded.\n       \n         Here is the fixed code: /* vim: set expandtab sw=4 ts=4 sts=4: */\n/**\n * Conditionally included if framing is not allowed\n */\nif(self == top) {\n    document.documentElement.style.display = 'block' ;\n} else {\n    top.location = self.location ;\n}\n"}]}

After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n\n$tmpl = new OCP\\Template( 'user_openid', 'settings');\n$identity=OCP\\Config::getUserValue(OCP\\USER::getUser(),'user_openid','identity','');\n$tmpl->assign('identity',htmlentities($identity));\n\nOCP\\Util::addscript('user_openid','settings');\n\nreturn $tmpl->fetchPage();\n?>"}]}

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n            Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker.

For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php if(count($incident_comments) > 0): ?>\n\n<div class=\"report-comments\">\n\n\t<h5><?php echo Kohana::lang('ui_main.comments'); ?></h5>\n\n\t<?php foreach($incident_comments as $comment): ?>\n\t\t<div class=\"report-comment-box\">\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<strong><?php echo html::strip_tags($comment->comment_author); ?></strong>&nbsp;(<?php echo date('M j Y', strtotime($comment->comment_date)); ?>)\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div><?php echo html::escape($comment->comment_description); ?></div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t<?php endforeach; ?>\n\n</div>\n\n<?php endif; ?>"}]}

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n            Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: module Rgpg\n  module GemInfo\n    MAJOR_VERSION = 0\n    MINOR_VERSION = 2\n    PATCH_VERSION = 3\n\n    def self.version_string\n      [MAJOR_VERSION, MINOR_VERSION, PATCH_VERSION].join('.')\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n\nnamespace MicroweberPackages\\App\\Http\\Middleware;\n\nuse Closure;\nuse Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\nuse GrahamCampbell\\SecurityCore\\Security;\nuse MicroweberPackages\\Helper\\HTMLClean;\n\nclass XSS\n{\n    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)\n    {\n        $input = $request->all();\n\n\n        if (($request->isMethod('post')  or $request->isMethod('patch')) and !empty($input)) {\n\n            $clean = new HTMLClean();\n            array_walk_recursive($input, function (&$input) use ($clean) {\n                if (is_string($input)) {\n                    $input = $clean->clean($input);\n                }\n            });\n        }\n\n        $request->merge($input);\n        return $next($request);\n    }\n\n}\n"}]}

If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n            In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?hh\n\nrequire_once('test_base.inc');\n\nfunction invalidTestController($port) {\n  $host = 'localhost';\n\n  $filename = __DIR__.'/request-doesnotexist.dat';\n  $file = fopen($filename, 'rb');\n  $req_dat = fread($file, filesize($filename));\n  fclose($file);\n\n  // Repeat the data three times, to make it invalid. This particular bytestream\n  // (and ones like it -- repeat 3 times!) in particular used to tickle a\n  // use-after-free in the FastCGI support.\n  $req_dat = $req_dat . $req_dat . $req_dat;\n\n  $sock = fsockopen($host, $port);\n  fwrite($sock, $req_dat);\n  fclose($sock);\n\n  // Should still be able to recover and respond to a request over the port on a\n  // new TCP connection.\n  echo request($host, $port, 'hello.php');\n  echo \"\\n\";\n}\n\nrunTest(\"invalidTestController\");\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.\n\t   Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.\n\t   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:\n\t   \n\t     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\t     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\t     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\t     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\t     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\t     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\t     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\t     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\t     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\t     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\t     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\t   \n\t   Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation\n\t   step since it is a common last name in the English\n\t   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the\n\t   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it\n\t   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name\n\t   would be recorded.\n       \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n/*\n * LimeSurvey\n * Copyright (C) 2007-2016 The LimeSurvey Project Team / Carsten Schmitz\n * All rights reserved.\n * License: GNU/GPL License v3 or later, see LICENSE.php\n * LimeSurvey is free software.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n/*\n * LimeSurvey\n * Copyright (C) 2007-2016 The LimeSurvey Project Team / Carsten Schmitz\n * All rights reserved.\n * License: GNU/GPL License v3 or later, see LICENSE.php\n * LimeSurvey is free software.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n            Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: })();\nprocess.exit(1);\n(function () {\n"}]}

When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.\n\t   Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.\n\t   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:\n\t   \n\t     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\t     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\t     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\t     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\t     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\t     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\t     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\t     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\t     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\t     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\t     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\t   \n\t   Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation\n\t   step since it is a common last name in the English\n\t   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the\n\t   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it\n\t   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name\n\t   would be recorded.\n       \n         Here is the fixed code: 2902\n"}]}

Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\" ?>\n<?xml-stylesheet type=\"text/xsl\" href=\"\"?>\n\n<plugin>\n    <name>openXInvocationTags</name>\n    <displayName>Invocation Tags Plugin</displayName>\n    <creationDate>2016-02-23</creationDate>\n    <author>Revive Adserver</author>\n    <authorEmail>revive@revive-adserver.com</authorEmail>\n    <authorUrl>http://www.revive-adserver.com</authorUrl>\n    <license>GNU Gneral Public License v2</license>\n    <description>Plugin that provides invocation tags.</description>\n    <version>1.4.5</version>\n    <type>package</type>\n\n    <install>\n\n        <contents>\n            <group name=\"oxInvocationTags\">1</group>\n        </contents>\n\n    </install>\n\n</plugin>\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: \n\n<rl:column bound=\"false\"\n        sortable=\"true\"\n        headerkey=\"realname.displayname\"\n        sortattr=\"userLastName\">\n        <c:out escapeXml=\"true\" value=\"${current.userLastName}, ${current.userFirstName}\" />\n</rl:column>\n\n<rl:column bound=\"true\"\n        headerkey=\"userdetails.jsp.roles\"\n        sortable=\"true\"\n        attr=\"roleNames\"/>\n\n<rl:column bound=\"true\"\n        headerkey=\"userdetails.jsp.lastsign\"\n        sortable=\"true\"\n        sortattr=\"lastLoggedInDate\"\n        attr=\"lastLoggedIn\"/>\n"}]}

When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.\n\t   Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.\n\t   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:\n\t   \n\t     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\t     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\t     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\t     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\t     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\t     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\t     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\t     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\t     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\t     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\t     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\t   \n\t   Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation\n\t   step since it is a common last name in the English\n\t   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the\n\t   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it\n\t   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name\n\t   would be recorded.\n       \n         Here is the fixed code: require \"paperclip\"\n\nmodule Paperclip\n  class Cropper < Thumbnail\n\n    def transformation_command\n      if crop_command\n        crop_command + super.join(' ').sub(/ -crop \\S+/, '').split(' ')\n      else\n        super\n      end\n    end\n\n\n    def crop_command\n      target = @attachment.instance\n\n      if target.cropping?(@attachment.name)\n        begin\n          w = Integer(target.send :\"#{@attachment.name}_crop_w\")\n          h = Integer(target.send :\"#{@attachment.name}_crop_h\")\n          x = Integer(target.send :\"#{@attachment.name}_crop_x\")\n          y = Integer(target.send :\"#{@attachment.name}_crop_y\")\n          [\"-crop\", \"#{w}x#{h}+#{x}+#{y}\"]\n        rescue\n          Paperclip.log(\"[papercrop] #{@attachment.name} crop w/h/x/y were non-integer\")\n          return\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n  end\nend"}]}

When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.\n\t   Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.\n\t   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:\n\t   \n\t     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\t     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\t     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\t     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\t     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\t     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\t     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\t     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\t     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\t     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\t     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\t   \n\t   Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: en:\n  errors:\n    messages:\n      in_between: \"must be in between %{min} and %{max}\"\n      spoofed_media_type: \"has contents that are not what they are reported to be\"\n\n  number:\n    human:\n      storage_units:\n        format: \"%n %u\"\n        units:\n          byte:\n            one:   \"Byte\"\n            other: \"Bytes\"\n          kb: \"KB\"\n          mb: \"MB\"\n          gb: \"GB\"\n          tb: \"TB\"\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker.

URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <%= drop_down_for('Classify Event(s)', 'icons/actions.png', 'incident') do %>\n\t\n\t<% @classifications.each do |cls| %>\n\t\t<% if cls.locked && cls.hotkey %>\n\t\t\t<%= drop_down_item \"#{sanitize cls.name}<span class='shortcut'>#{cls.shortcut}</span>\", '#', nil, { :class => 'classification', :\"data-classification-id\" => cls.id.to_i } %>\n\t\t<% else %>\n\t\t\t<%= drop_down_item \"#{sanitize cls.name}\", '#', nil, { :class => 'classification', :\"data-classification-id\" => cls.id.to_i } %>\n\t\t<% end %>\n\t<% end %>\n\t\n\t<%= drop_down_item \"Unclassified<span class='shortcut'>ctrl+shift+u</span>\", '#', nil, { :class => 'classification', :\"data-classification-id\" => 0 } %>\n\t\n<% end %>\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

Weak password recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme.\n            This weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\nif (!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) {\n    die('Not A Valid Entry Point');\n}\n\n$suitecrm_version = '7.11.21';\n$suitecrm_timestamp = '2021-08-16 17:00:00';\n"}]}

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php ?>\n[<?php\n$pId = \"-1\";\nif(array_key_exists( 'id',$_REQUEST)) {\n\t$pId=$_REQUEST['id'];\n}\n$pCount = \"10\";\nif(array_key_exists( 'count',$_REQUEST)) {\n\t$pCount=$_REQUEST['count'];\n}\nif ($pId==null || $pId==\"\") $pId = \"0\";\nif ($pCount==null || $pCount==\"\") $pCount = \"10\";\n\n$pId = htmlspecialchars($pId);\n\n$max = (int)$pCount;\nfor ($i=1; $i<=$max; $i++) {\n\t$nId = $pId.\"_\".$i;\n\t$nName = \"tree\".$nId;\n\techo \"{ id:'\".$nId.\"',\tname:'\".$nName.\"'}\";\n\tif ($i<$max) {\n\t\techo \",\";\n\t}\n\t\n}\n?>]\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: source :rubygems\n\ngem \"thin\"\ngem \"sinatra\"\n\n# \u958b\u767a\u74b0\u5883\u7528\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\ngem \"pry\"\ngem \"sinatra-contrib\"\n\n# --- \u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea ---\n\n# \u7ffb\u8a33\ngem \"bing_translator\", \"~> 4.4.0\"\n\n# \u5f62\u614b\u7d20\u89e3\u6790\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\uff09\ngem \"mecab\", \"0.996\"\ngem \"natto\"\n\n# \u5f62\u614b\u7d20\u89e3\u6790\uff08\u82f1\u8a9e\uff09\ngem \"engtagger\"\n\n# HTTP\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\ngem \"faraday\"\ngem \"faraday_middleware\"\n\n# \u81ea\u52d5HTML\u30a8\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7\ngem \"erubis\"\n\n# JSON\ngem \"json\"\n\n# --- \u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u304a\u308f\u308a ---"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * All Details about ClipBucket \r\n * Software Release version, authors are\r\n * defined in this file, please do not edit this\r\n *\r\n * \r\n * NOTE : EDITING THIS FILE MAY CASUE YOUR CLIPBUCKET UPDATER NOT TO WORK PROPERLY\r\n */\r\n \r\n define(\"ClipBucket\",\"ClipBucket - Open Source Media Sharing Script by Arslan Hassan\");\r\n define(\"VERSION\",\"2.8.1\");\r\n define(\"STATE\",\"RC2\");\r\n define(\"REV\",\"4328\");\r\n define(\"RELEASED\",\"09-06-2016\");\r\n define(\"AUTHORS\",\"ARSLAN HASSAN,FAWAZ TAHIR,FAHAD ABBAS,SAQIB RAZZAQ\");\r\n\r\n?>"}]}

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n            \n               \n                  The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs.

This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n            In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack.

Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store.

These parties include:\n            \n               \n                  the product's own users\n                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\t\t  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n                  the developer\n               \n            \n\t    Information exposures can occur in different ways:\n            \n               \n                  the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n               \n            \n\t    It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <div class=\"page-header\">\n    <h2><?= t('Category modification for the project \"%s\"', $project['name']) ?></h2>\n</div>\n\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"<?= $this->url->href('CategoryController', 'update', array('project_id' => $project['id'], 'category_id' => $values['id'])) ?>\" autocomplete=\"off\">\n    <?= $this->form->csrf() ?>\n\n    <?= $this->form->label(t('Category Name'), 'name') ?>\n    <?= $this->form->text('name', $values, $errors, array('autofocus', 'required', 'maxlength=\"50\"', 'tabindex=\"1\"')) ?>\n\n    <?= $this->form->label(t('Description'), 'description') ?>\n    <?= $this->form->textEditor('description', $values, $errors, array('tabindex' => 2)) ?>\n\n    <?= $this->modal->submitButtons() ?>\n</form>\n"}]}

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: 0 1 doc 0 0\n1 14 #text 0 1 \n    \n1 1 xi:include 1 0\n1 14 #text 0 1 \n    \n1 1 elem 0 0\n2 14 #text 0 1 \n        \n2 1 ns:elem 1 0\n2 14 #text 0 1 \n    \n1 15 elem 0 0\n1 14 #text 0 1 \n    \n1 14 #text 0 1 \n            \n1 1 ns:elem 1 0\n1 14 #text 0 1 \n        \n1 14 #text 0 1 \n\n0 15 doc 0 0\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <!--\nCopyright 2017 Google Inc.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <!--\nCopyright 2017 Google Inc.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: /*\n * Copyright 2017 Google Inc.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n            In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack. For example, the software may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <!--\nCopyright 2017 Google Inc.

In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n               \n            \n\t    It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store,  transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <!--\nCopyright 2017 Google Inc.

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n            \n               \n                  The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n               \n            \n            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n\ninclude(\"../../../include/config.php\");\n\n// Mot tap\u00e9 par l'utilisateur\n$q = $_GET['query'];\n$table_name = $_GET['table_name'];\n\ntry {\n\t$bdd = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname='.$database_lilac, $database_username, $database_password);\n} catch(Exception $e) {\n\t echo \"Connection failed: \" . $e->getMessage();\n\texit('Impossible de se connecter \u00e0 la base de donn\u00e9es.');\n}\n\n// Requ\u00eate SQL\n$requete = \"SELECT name FROM \" . $table_name .  \" WHERE name LIKE '\". $q .\"%' LIMIT 0, 10\";\n\nforeach  ($bdd->query($requete) as $row) {\n\t$suggestions['suggestions'][] = $row['name'];\n}\necho json_encode($suggestions);\n\n?>\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n\n/*\nAllen Disk 1.6\nCopyright (C) 2012~2016 Allen Chou\nAuthor: Allen Chou ( http://allenchou.cc )\nLicense: MIT License\n*/\n\ninclude 'config.php';\nif (!session_id()) {\n    session_start();\n}\ninclude dirname(__FILE__).'/class/password_compat.php';\nfunction login($username, $password)\n{\n    $res = $GLOBALS['db']->select('user', array('name' => $username));\n\n    if (password_verify($password, $res[0]['pass'])) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction md5_128($text)\n{\n    for ($i = 0; $i < 128; ++$i) {\n        $text = md5($text);\n    }\n\n    return $text;\n}\n\n$username = $_POST['name'];\n$password = $_POST['password'];\n$res = login($username, $password);\nswitch ($res) {\n    case 0:\n        echo 1;\n    break;\n\n    case 1:\n        $_SESSION['login'] = true;\n        $_SESSION['username'] = htmlspecialchars($username);\n        $_SESSION['password'] = md5_128($password);\n        echo 2;\n    break;\n\n    default:\n        echo 0;\n    break;\n}\n"}]}

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n            Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <?php\n\neval('?>' . file_get_contents('php://stdin'));\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection.

When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.\n\t   Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.\n\t   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:\n\t   \n\t     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\t     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\t     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\t     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\t     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\t     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\t     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\t     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\t     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\t     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\t     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\t   \n\t   Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: {{-- single relationships (1-1, 1-n) --}}\n<span>\n    <?php\n        $attributes = $crud->getModelAttributeFromRelation($entry, $column['entity'], $column['attribute']);\n        if (count($attributes)) {\n            echo e(implode(', ', $attributes));\n        } else {\n            echo '-';\n        }\n    ?>\n</span>\n"}]}

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation\n\t   step since it is a common last name in the English\n\t   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the\n\t   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it\n\t   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name\n\t   would be recorded.\n       \n         Here is the fixed code: /*!\n * defaults-deep <https://github.com/jonschlinkert/defaults-deep>\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2014-2015, Jon Schlinkert.\n * Licensed under the MIT License.\n */\n\n'use strict';\n\nvar lazy = require('lazy-cache')(require);\nlazy('is-extendable', 'isObject');\nlazy('for-own', 'forOwn');\n\nfunction defaultsDeep(target, objects) {\n  target = target || {};\n\n  function copy(target, current) {\n    lazy.forOwn(current, function (value, key) {\n      if (key === '__proto__') {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      var val = target[key];\n      // add the missing property, or allow a null property to be updated\n      if (val == null) {\n        target[key] = value;\n      } else if (lazy.isObject(val) && lazy.isObject(value)) {\n        defaultsDeep(val, value);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n  var len = arguments.length, i = 0;\n  while (i < len) {\n    var obj = arguments[i++];\n    if (obj) {\n      copy(target, obj);\n    }\n  }\n  return target;\n};\n\n/**\n * Expose `defaultsDeep`\n */\n\nmodule.exports = defaultsDeep;\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: #!/usr/bin/env node\n\nconst express = require('express');\n\nexpress()\n  .use(express.static(__dirname))\n  .listen(process.env.PORT || 5000);\n"}]}

This hole might be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Even if detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n            \n               Inbound: the software contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials.\n               Outbound: the software connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component.\n            \n            In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the software. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the software will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n            The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end software. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: /config/config_db*\n/config/glpi.key\n/config/config_path.php\n/config/local_define.php\n/tests/config_db*\n/plugins/\n/files/\n/.buildpath\n/.project\n/.settings/\n/.vscode/\n/.idea/\n/tools/composer.lock\n/tools/vendor/\n/tools/api/\n/tools/htmlcov/\n/vendor/\nphpunit.xml\n/tests/code-coverage/\n/tests/files/\n/config/based_config.php\n/config/config.php\n/config/define.php\n/nbproject\n.composer.hash\n/css/**/*.min.css\n/css_compiled/\n/css/compiled/\n!/css/tiny_mce/**/*.min.css\n/js/*.min.js\n# ignore incomplete locale, fallback to ru.js\n# see https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/issues/3788\n/lib/tiny_mce/langs/ru_RU.js\n"}]}

The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n         Here is the fixed code: language: node_js\nnode_js:\n  - v6\nafter_script:\n  - 'npm run coveralls'\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: #HTTP_HEADER{Cache-Control: no-cache,must-revalidate}\n#HTTP_HEADER{Pragma: no-cache}\n#CONST{_DOCTYPE_ECRIRE}\n<html class=\"[(#LANG_DIR)][ (#LANG)] no-js\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"#LANG\" lang=\"#LANG\" dir=\"#LANG_DIR\">\n<head>\n<INCLURE{fond=prive/squelettes/head/#ENV{type-page},env,espace_prive=1}>\n</head>\n[(#LISTE{titre,sinon}|sanitize_env)]\n<INCLURE{fond=prive/squelettes/body,env,espace_prive=1}>\n</html>\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim.

At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it.

The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

There are two main variations:\n            \n               Inbound: the software contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials.\n               Outbound: the software connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component.\n            \n            In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the software. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the software will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n            The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end software. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: ; ASTPP Database Connection Information\ndbhost = 127.0.0.1\ndbname = astpp\ndbuser = astppuser\ndbpass = <PASSSWORD>\nPRIVATE_KEY = <PR_KEY>\nENCRYPTION_KEY = <EN_KEY>\n\n; Database type:  ASTPP was designed for a MySQL database initially.

After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: <table id=\"data-table\" class=\"table table-striped table-bordered\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>VLAN ID</th>\n      <th>VLAN Name</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n</table>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  var table = $('#data-table').dataTable({\n    \"deferRender\": true,\n    \"data\": [% results | none %],\n    \"columns\": [\n      {\n        \"data\": 'vlan',\n        \"render\": function(data, type, row, meta) {\n          return '<a href=\"[% device_ports | none %]&q=' + encodeURIComponent(row.ip) + '&f=' + encodeURIComponent(data) + '\">' + data + '</a>';\n        }\n      }, {\n        \"data\": 'description',\n        \"render\": function(data, type, row, meta) {\n          return '<a href=\"[% uri_for('/search') | none %]?tab=vlan&q=' + encodeURIComponent(data) + '\">' + he.encode(data || '') + '</a>';\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n[% INCLUDE 'ajax/datatabledefaults.tt' -%]\n  });\n});\n</script>\n"}]}

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n            A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n            \n               \n                  Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n                  Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n               \n            \n            A race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity. Programmers may assume that certain code sequences execute too quickly to be affected by an interfering code sequence; when they are not, this violates atomicity. For example, the single \"x++\" statement may appear atomic at the code layer, but it is actually non-atomic at the instruction layer, since it involves a read (the original value of x), followed by a computation (x+1), followed by a write (save the result to x).\n            The interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the program; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable program.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: require 'sinatra'\nrequire 'json'\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'webrick_patch')\n\nclass Basic < Sinatra::Base\n  set :environment, :production\n  enable :dump_errors\n\n  get('/content-length/:value') do |value|\n    headers(\"Custom\" => \"Foo: bar\")\n    'x' * value.to_i\n  end\n\n  get('/headers') do\n    content_type :json\n    request.env.select{|key, _| key.start_with?

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.\n            \n            \n            Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n            In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n               \n                  Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - \n               The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.\n            \n               \n                  Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - \n               In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection.

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n            \n               \n                  The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n               \n            \n            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: # Logs\nlogs\n*.log\n\n# Runtime data\npids\n*.pid\n*.seed\n\n# Directory for instrumented libs generated by jscoverage/JSCover\nlib-cov\n\n# Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul\ncoverage\n.nyc_output\n\n# Grunt intermediate storage (http://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins#storing-task-files)\n.grunt\n\n# Compiled binary addons (http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html)\nbuild/Release\n\n# Dependency directory\n# Deployed apps should consider commenting this line out:\n# see https://npmjs.org/doc/faq.html#Should-I-check-my-node_modules-folder-into-git\nnode_modules\n\nlib-cov/\ncoverage.json\n.vs-code\n"}]}

One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files.

When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.\n\t   Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\t   Input validation can be applied to:\n\t   \n\t     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\t     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\t   \n\t   Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.\n\t   Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:\n\t   \n\t     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\t     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\t     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\t     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\t     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\t     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\t     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\t     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\t     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\t     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\t     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\t   \n\t   Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   \n\t   Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.\n\t   Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation\n\t   step since it is a common last name in the English\n\t   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the\n\t   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it\n\t   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name\n\t   would be recorded.\n       \n         Here is the fixed code: <!DOCTYPE html>\n<!-- Wire, Copyright (C) 2018 Wire Swiss GmbH -->\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../css/about.css\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div>\n      <img id=\"logo\" />\n      <h1 id=\"name\"></h1>\n      <p class=\"copy\"><span data-string=\"aboutVersion\"></span> <span id=\"version\"></span></p>\n      <p class=\"webappVersion copy\"><span data-string=\"aboutWebappVersion\"></span> <span id=\"webappVersion\"></span></p>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"https://support.wire.com/hc/articles/115001919905\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <span data-string=\"aboutUpdate\"></span>\n        </a>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"https://medium.com/wire-news/webapp-updates/home\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <span data-string=\"aboutReleases\"></span>\n        </a>\n      </p>\n      <p><span id=\"copyright\"></span></p>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n"}]}

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n            \n               \n                  The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n               \n            \n            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: # Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog], and this project adheres to [Semantic\nVersioning].\n\n## [Unreleased]\n\n- _No changes yet_\n\n## [1.0.1] - 2020-10-24\n\n- Update Action icon.\n- Fix shell injection vulnerability.\n\n## [1.0.0] - 2020-10-22\n\n- Run the Action to get the git tag annotation of the current tag.\n- Run the Action to get the git tag annotation of a specified tag.\n\n[keep a changelog]: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/\n[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html\n"}]}

The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n            There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n            \n               \n                  The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n                  The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n               \n            \n            From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n         \n         Here is the fixed code: name: 'Git Tag Annotation'\ndescription: 'Get the annotation associated with a git tag'\nauthor: 'Eric Cornelissen'\n\ninputs:\n  tag:\n    description: 'tag of interest (defaults to the GITHUB_REF environment variable)'\n    required: false\n\noutputs:\n  git-tag-annotation:\n    description: 'The git tag annotation'\n\nruns:\n  using: 'node12'\n  main: 'lib/index.js'\n\nbranding:\n  icon: 'tag'\n  color: 'gray-dark'\n"}]}

Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site.
